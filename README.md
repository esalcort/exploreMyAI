## How far back in history can a LSTM remember?

### Utils needed:
exploremyai/
	utils/
		data_sets.py
		models.py
		pattern_generator.py

### Sample script: exploremyai/examples/univariate_seq_lstm_exploration.py
It creates a timeseries data set where a pattern of given length is repeated multiple times. The timeseries is transformed to a supervised learning problem and a single-layer LSTM is evaluated.
